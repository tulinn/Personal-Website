I’m Tulin. As the first woman engineer in my family and a tech enthusiast, I'm studying management engineering at University of Waterloo. I’m from Adana, a large city located in southern Turkey that is mostly known for it’s spicy kebabs. I've been living in Canada for a while now but I'm still trying to adapt to it's cold weather... 

I like thinking about products and how people use them. Furthermore, I love working with people to create remarkable user experiences. I've always been passionate about making an impact on people’s lives through software and design. In my previous internships I've taken roles of PM, software developer and business technology analyst. I’ve always taken the initiative to go the extra mile and to improve the company. 

Trying new things always gets me excited! I enjoy reading, solving challenging problems and cooking (though I enjoy eating more :D). The reason I'm writing is because I'm a curious person and I love sharing my findings. So stay tuned!
