I’m Tulin. As the first woman engineer in my family and a tech enthusiast, I'm studying management engineering at University of Waterloo. I’m from Adana, a large city located in southern Turkey that is mostly known for it’s spicy kebabs. I've been living in Canada for a while now but I'm still trying to adapt to it's cold weather... I find learning and coding fun. Trying new things always gets me excited! I enjoy reading, solving challenging problems and cooking (though I enjoy eating more :D). The reason I'm writing is because I'm a curious person and I love sharing my findings. So stay tuned!
